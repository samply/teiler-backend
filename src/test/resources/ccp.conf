#### A note on Secrets:
####
#### Variable with a value of <VAULT> will be fetched from a central component
#### upon each bridgehead startup.
#### Using the proven Vaultwarden password manager puts you in full control of
#### who can read the passwords. In particular, as long as you don't declare a
#### secret as shared ("SITE+DKFZ"), DKFZ cannot read these strings.
#### We recommend putting credentials such as local passwords into the password
#### store, not the git repo. Please keep your master password safe (vault.conf).
